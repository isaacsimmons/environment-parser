# Project Name

Basic mission statement.

TODO: Name it something better (maybe not just TS? should work for JS projects as well?)

// Plug dotenv
Works well with dotenv.

## Example Usage

TODO: test suite
TODO: lots of docs and examples

FIXME: should typescript be a dev dependency and not a regular one?

TODO: toss EnvReader, embed the getAny() behavior into settings
TODO: SettingsConfig { string: BasicFieldOptions } (but how do I do the extra StringOptions/NumericOptions? maybe they're just folded into Basic? I guess I can still have getInt() be a function that creates the extra validators, it just needs to return the options instead of the EnvReader)
